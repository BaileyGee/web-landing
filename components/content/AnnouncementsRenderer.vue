      "Hi Everyone,\n\nExcuse the tag but very exciting times ahead!\n\nI'd like to officially introduce @‚Äãchriso_88 to you in a more official setting - Chris is the Product Manager at Mwave.com.au - Australias Largest online tech retailer. \n\nMWAVE and Logitech have partnered with myself for some streaming fun and giveaways which will expand to not only my stream community but the FDG Community as a whole. We've never partnered with anyone previously given that often brands that have approached us don't share our values, however a brand like Logitech and a business like Mwave is obviously a no brainer that our values align. We all want one thing, to game more and businesses like mwave and Logitech facilitate that.\n\nSo for anyone who is looking to upgrade there PC head to <#1135373432230531183> and have a chat with Chris, he'll hook you up with anything from basic advice to full quotes for systems.\n\nTo kick off our partnership tonight we're giving away a Logitech G915 TKL LIGHTSPEED Keyboard on stream, we'll be live shortly after this message. Give away opens and is drawn tonight!\n\nhttps://streamelements.com/deveraux/giveaway/64ca2bed82bdc956d849ad40\n\n@here @Fat Duck Family @Tier 2 Supporter @Tier 2 Supporter @Team Deveraux Subscriber",

# How to Appeal an Administrative Decision


## Administrative Appeals

FDG has high standards and treats all situations with objectivity. If you believe your administrative action was placed in error you are well within your right to appeal the decision. All administrative appeals are reviewed by senior staff members and are placed under scrutiny where all information is assessed as a decision is concluded.

Please note, an apology for your actions is not an acceptable reason to appeal an administrative action.

## The Appeals Process

Once your appeal has been submitted it will be reviewed by the senior staff team, during this process we ask you to wait patiently for the result, messaging staff or tagging staff in the FDG discord may result in your appeal being instantly rejected. After your appeal has been reviewed, you will be alerted of this outcome. This decision is final and we expect all members of The FDG community to respect the process and the decision. Harassing staff members regarding your appeals outcome is not tolerated.

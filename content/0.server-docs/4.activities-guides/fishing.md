# Fishing Guide

By **Mike Hydra** & **Jono Lad**

## Approaches to Fishing

To fish, you'll first need some bait for your fishing rod. There are **two** general approaches to fishing:

1. You get a Grade 7 Bait and use it the whole time
2. You use Lower grade bait to get small fish to re-use on your fishing rod to get higher fish that sell for more.

Both approaches work. You can figure out what earns more, or perhaps you can find an even better approach.

## Gathering Bait

### Approach 1 - Grade 7 Bait

1. Go and kill an animal with either a **hunting rifle** or **crossbow**.

2. Skin the deceased animal by equipping a **knife** and using your `E` interaction menu on it. You'll receive **Red Meat**.

3. Use a **Hunters Knife** (purchasable from Ammunation) on the **Red Meat**. You'll receive **Redmeat Bait Bits** (Grade 7).

### Approach 2 - Low Grade Bait

1. Go to a **Fish Shop**. To locate a Fish Shop, open the **Maps** app on your phone. Click the only button you can and then click on the fish icon, this shows all the stores for fishing. Note, you can come back to this to find the sell blip later.

2. Buy some **Low Grade Fishing Bait** from the **Fish shop**.

## Using the Fishing Rod 

1. Purchase a **Fishing Rod** from the **Fish Shop**.

2. Drag the chosen bait onto the fishing rod.

3. Make your way to the water's edge. Any beachside location should do the trick.

4. Use the fishing rod (you can put the fishing rod on your hotbar if you want). 

5. After you use the fishing rod, a few things can happen:
    - Your bait is consumed, but you catch nothing. You'll need to put some more bait on your rod and try again (see step 2).
    - Your bait is consumed and you catch something. You can put some more bait on your rod and keep going (see step 2).
    - You'll be told something along the lines of *'...the fish aren't biting...'*. Move a few meters up or down the beach and try again.

## Selling Your Catch

When you're ready to sell the fish you've caught, head to the fish sale location using the same **Maps** app as before (see [above](#approach-2---low-grade-bait)).

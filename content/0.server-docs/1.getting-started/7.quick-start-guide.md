## Step 1: Create your Character

## Step 2: Getting your Driver's License

To operate a car, you'll need a driver's license. Operating a vehicle without the appropriate license is an offence and could get you in trouble with the Police.

1. Make your way to the **Driving School** found near the airport.

2. Find the **yellow interaction blip** inside the building. From here, you can perform the **written and practical test** necessary to attain your driver's license.

3. Complete the **written test**. You can browse all the road and traffic rules in the [San Andreas Register of Law](https://law.fatduckgaming.com/laws/traffic).

4. Complete the **practical test**. Remember, you must adhere to all the [road and traffic rules](https://law.fatduckgaming.com/laws/traffic).

5. Once both tests are complete, make your way to the **Government Building** to print out your new driver's license.

6. Find the **green interaction blip** inside the Government Building to print out your new driver's license. The game will take control of your character momentarily to take a license mugshot.

::alert{type="success"}
:icon{name="noto:sparkles"} Amazing stuff! You're now the proud holder of a valid driver's license. Next up, buying a car.

## Step 3: Getting your First Car

Getting started in a new city can be difficult. Luckily, one of the local vehicle dealerships runs a special offer for new-comers. Premium Deluxe Motorsport ('PDM') allows all new-comers to purchase one Glendale, **free-of-charge**! To claim your free Glendale:

1. Make your way to PDM.

2. Speak to one of the dealers and let them know you're new to the city and wish to claim your free Glendale.

3. Should you ever wish to **store your vehicle**, visit any of the **public garages** located across the city to store your vehicle at no cost.

::alert{type="success"}
:icon{name="noto:sparkles"} Look at you go! You've bought your first car. Now, drive yourself to the phone shop.
::

## Step 4: Purchase a Mobile Phone & Radio

Phones and radios are used in the city like you would use a phone in the real world. A phone will let you add contacts, text or call mates, browse Twitter and manage your finances. Radios allow two-way communication over distance, you should be using an in-game radio **instead** of Discord, as leaking [in-character (IC) information](/server-docs/getting-started/ic-vs-ooc) to someone who ought not to be aware of that information via [out-of-character (OOC)](/server-docs/getting-started/ic-vs-ooc) is against the [rules](/server-docs/rules/fivem-rules). But to use a phone and/or radio, you'll need one in your inventory.

1. Make your way to an **electronics shop**.

2. Find the **counter** inside the store and open the storefront using `G`. This is where you buy stuff, and it's the same protocol for almost every storefront in the city.

3. To purchase a phone, just drag one of them from the `Quack Electronics City` to your `Personal Inventory`.

![Electronics shop inventory](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/898109006902599730/1123897679399878727/image.png)

4. Once you've purchased the phone, close the storefront using the `ESC` key.

4. To use the phone, press `F1`. We won't explain how to use the phone, we're sure you've used a phone before. Right?

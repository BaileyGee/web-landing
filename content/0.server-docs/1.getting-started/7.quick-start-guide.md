## Step 1: Create your Character

## Step 2: Getting your Driver's License

To operate a car, you'll need a driver's license. Operating a vehicle without the appropriate license is an offence and could get you in trouble with the Police.

1. Make your way to the Driving School.

## Step 3: Getting your First Car

Getting started in a new city can be difficult. Luckily, one of the local vehicle dealerships runs a special offer for new-comers. Premium Deluxe Motorsport ('PDM') allows all new-comers to purchase one Glendale, **free-of-charge**! To claim your free Glendale:

1. Make your way to PDM.

2. Speak to one of the dealers and let them know you're new to the city and wish to claim your free Glendale.

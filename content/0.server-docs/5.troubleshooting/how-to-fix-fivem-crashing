## **Update Graphics Drivers**

Outdated graphics drivers can often cause crashes. Visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer (such as NVIDIA or AMD) and download the latest drivers for your specific model. Install the drivers and restart your computer to apply the changes.

## **Verify Game Files**

If you are experiencing crashes specifically in relation to GTA V content, it is important to verify the game files. Open the Rockstar Games Launcher (or Steam if that's how you have the game installed) and navigate to the settings or library section. Find GTA V in your game list and look for the option to verify the integrity or integrity check for game files. This process will check for any corrupted or missing files and fix them if required.

## **Disable Antivirus/Firewall**

Sometimes, antivirus or firewall software can interfere with FiveM's functionality and cause crashes. Temporarily disable your antivirus and firewall programs to see if the crashes persist. If the issue no longer occurs, you should whitelist FiveM in your security software or adjust its settings accordingly.

## **Disable Resource-Heavy Modifications**

If you have installed additional mods or resource packs in FiveM, it is possible that one of them is causing conflicts and crashes. Temporarily remove any resource-heavy modifications and restart FiveM to see if the crashes stop. If this resolves the issue, try adding the mods back one by one to identify the problematic one.

## **Close Unnecessary Background Processes**

Ensure that you don't have any resource-intensive programs or unnecessary background processes running while playing FiveM. Close unused applications, especially those that consume a lot of memory or CPU power, as they can potentially conflict with FiveM and lead to crashes.

## **Update FiveM**

Make sure you are using the latest version of FiveM. Developers frequently release updates and bug fixes that can address crashes and stability issues. Check the official FiveM website or relevant forums to download and install the most recent version.

## **Still Crashing?**

If the crashes continue after following these steps, consider seeking assistance from the FiveM community forums, official support channels, or contacting the FiveM developers directly for more specific troubleshooting options.

Remember to always provide detailed information about the crashes, such as any error messages, recent changes, or specific patterns to help others assist you in finding a solution.

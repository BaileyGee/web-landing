## Having Issues with your Tebex?

The Tebex roles are synced to the server using your CFX (FiveM account). Please ensure you are logged into the **correct CFX account** in your **FiveM settings menu**.

## Need Staff Support?

For assistance with your Tebex subscription please open a support ticket on our [Support Portal](https://support.fatduckgaming.com/tickets/create), accessible at https://support.fatduckgaming.com/tickets/create. Our staff will assist as soon as possible. 

To protect privacy, only a select few members of the staff team can access Tebex information and support tickets. For this reason, some Tebex-related issues can take **several days to resolve**. We appreciate your patience in advance.

You can also ask quick questions using the `#fivem-support` channel in our community [Discord](https://discord.gg/fatduckgaming).

## Discord Roles

The discord role is assigned automatically via the Tebex bot, this role is not manually assigned by staff. Please ensure you link your discord correctly during checkout as it **cannot be linked later**.

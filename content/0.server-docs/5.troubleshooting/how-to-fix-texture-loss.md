If you are experiencing texture loss here are some tips to reduce it so you can enjoy **Fivem** to the fullest.

::alert{type="warning"}
Texture loss can be caused by numerous reasons this guide is just tips on common ways to fix it.
::

### Increase Texture Budget
Increasing your texture budget is probably the most common way to fix texture loss and most effective usually, it's really simple here's how you do it.

1. Once inside Fivem Open up the `ESC` Menu and navigate to the `SETTINGS` page,

2. Once inside the `SETTINGS` page navigate to the `GRAPHICS` page and click on it,

3. When in the `GRAPHICS` page scroll down a tiny bit till you find `Extended Texture Budget`,

4. Click on `Extended Texture Budget` and increase it, I recommend having the bar around `75%` full but you can set it to whatever *setting it to 100% can sometimes cause issues and too much load on your device. Make to keep your total memory bar in settings out of the red or yellow*.

### Clear Your Fivem Cache
Clearing out your fivem cache is a good thing to do every so often as it has some benefits check out how to do it in a guide which can be found [here](/server-docs/troubleshooting/how-to-clear-fivem-cache).

### Always Exit A Server Properly
Always fully quit fivem when rejoining a server so the game isn't having any texture conflicts.

### Quality Settings
Instead of giving your computer a run for its money and having your texture quality settings on `Very High` set them to `Medium` or `High` in the settings menu *some settings will require a game restart*.

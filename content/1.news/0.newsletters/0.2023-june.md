![Newsletter banner](https://www.fatduckgaming.com/uploads/monthly_2022_01/Untitled.png.f1d77bfc1a9fa56b7d231d3e76a13c50.png)

Hello all, welcome back to the Fat Duck Gaming Monthly newsletter. May has been a Month focused on new updates and changes to the whole server where possible. Our new Trial Developers Ridge, Joey & Fazz all have performed and done an outstanding amount of work throughout May which includes, but isn't limited to blindfolds by Joey, boltcutters by Ridge and changes to metas surrounding drug pushing by Fazz!

There's plenty more to come from them, a couple of big projects in the pipeline which are top secret right now but will eventually come. You can review more of their changes and changed by the entire development team by making sure to keep up to date with the "Dev Updates" channel in our main discord.

## Community Events

Throughout May Quack Events did what it does best and sponsored MORE than one event a day throughout the Month of May. This was done by supervising, spawning and helping out with prizes for almost every event hosted during May.

On top of this, we held a few events of our own, the Mayoral election as well as the Desert Eagle skin competition that finishes this evening with plenty of really awesome designs by members of our community.

We encourage members of the community to submit support tickets when they want help with an event as long as its not unreasonable, though we can work together to negotiate differences back and forth.

To stay up to date with all updates and changes, join our Discord at the link provided and make sure to keep up to date with these Newsletters as they're released.

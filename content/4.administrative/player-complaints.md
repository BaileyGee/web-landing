# Player Complaints
Applicable across the entire FDG Community
## Submitting a report
FDG has rules in place to ensure a fair and enjoyable gaming experience for all. We understand some may fall victim to a rule breach. Therefore we offer multiple avenues to submit a report against a player. Staff assess all situations objectively to ensure a fair and just outcome is concluded. 

## Submitting an in-game report 
While in game press "`T`" to open up the FDG command console. Type `/report` (a brief description of the event that occurred) an online staff member will reply and be able to assist. You may be told to join the waiting room located in the official FDG discord under the “Staff” category. This is where you are able to present your case, be sure to have evidence in the form of a video clip to assist staff in their investigation. During this process please respect the staff team regardless of the outcome. Harassment to the staff team is not tolerated or accepted.

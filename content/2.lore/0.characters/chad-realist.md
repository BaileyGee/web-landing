Chad the Realest, the current Mayor of Los Santos and host of the Real Talk Podcast, is a multifaceted character known for his impactful presence in the city. He takes credit for revitalizing the trucking sector, although the evidence supporting this claim is dubious. Chad is widely recognized for his teenage angst, penchant for pathological lying, and exceptional "rizzing" skill, setting him apart in the city's landscape. Despite serving as The Vandals' emblematic figurehead, there's a common misconception that he holds the position of 1ic, showcasing the complexity and intrigue surrounding Chad's character in the vibrant world of Los Santos.

The Delucci Family was formally known as the "Brothers" until a incident occured on the 11th of April 2022. Luke Wiki was murdered in cold blood by his own brothers Hone and Wade, when this occured everyone else in the family was shocked so they decided to go their own path. About two weeks later Mario came back home from Italy after he spent his Holiday there with his Grand father 'Mr. Delucci'.

When Mario came to Los Santos his goal was to continue his Grandfathers legacy which was "The Delucci Famiglia", the most notorious and ruthless mafia in Italy which has been running for the last five decades. Mario saw the perfect opportunity in Los Santos so he decided to approach the members that were previously in 'Brothers' and since then they've been apart of the famiglia. The Delucci Legacy has been running for just over a year now in Los Santos and since then civilians and the SAPF have witnessed and experienced how ruthless the Delucci's really are.

The Delucci Famiglia are also know for trafficking mass narcotics whether it would be Class B or Class A, trafficking large amounts of firearms and attachments. Throughout their time of trafficking all these illegal goods they've been raided by the SAPF, have had their narcotics, weapons and attachment dealers shutdown by the Criminal Investigation Branch and along with those many, many outlaw and firearm prohibition orders have been issued to the Delucci's. 

The Delucci's are also known for having the best pizza in town located on Vinewood Boulevard, if you wish to visit their pizza shop it is called 'Pizza This'. There are also rumours around town that the Delucci Family have been money laundering through their Pizza business with upwards of $20,000,000 being made a month!

The Delucci's now reside at the Gentry Manor located on Gentry Lane, this large estate has been the home of the Delucci's ever since they started their legacy in Los Santos. They were working out of a garage at start but through time they have accumulated millions of dollars and they managed to upgrade their home into a multi-million dollar mansion. Their mansion has many things such as two bedrooms, lounge room, casino room, bosses office, a enormous garage and access to their balcony that has a wonderful view over the whole city. It is also rumoured that they have a secret underground dungeon where they store their highest quality wine and a torture room that many people have experienced.
